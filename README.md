## lisp-unit

*lisp-unit* is a Common Lisp library that supports unit testing. It is
an extension of the [library written by Chris Riesbeck][orig]. There
is a long history of testing packages in Lisp, usually called
"regression" testers. More recent packages in Lisp and other languages
have been inspired by [JUnit for Java][JUnit].

Recently longtime users at Acceleration.net felt motivated to refactor
significantly, trying to make some sweeping improvments

### Features
* Written in portable Common Lisp
* Loadable with [ASDF] or [Quicklisp]
* Simple to define and run tests
* Redfine functions and macros without reloading tests - tests are
  recompiled before each run
* Test return values, printed output, macro expansions, and conditions
* Store all test results in a database object that can be examined
* Tests grouped and accessed by name, tag, and package of test name
* Signals for starting and completing test runs (both individually and
  as a group)

#### Features of lisp-unit version 2
* Simplified test retrieval / categorization.
 * Tests are stored by their name's symbol-package (easing the
   complexity of this package vs the package argument)
 * package arguments now just retrieve all tests in a given package
 * dynamic variable consolidation (eg: one test database with three hashtables
   instead of three dynamic variables containing hashtables)
* All output goes to its own stream (and can therefore be manipulated
  at will). *test-stream* defaults to *standard-output* as it always
  has.
* Debugging is controlled by *debug-hook*, continue restart activated
  around test
* Tests are named functions that show up on the stack (so that 
  goto-definition in a stack trace brings you to the test definition
* Contexts can be applied on a test or a run-test(s) to provide common
  setup/tear down locations (eg: provide a database to tests that need
  it).  Contexts are functions that accept a thunk and apply it inside
  of a dynamic context eg: 
  `(lambda (body-thunk) (let ((*var* 1))(funcall body-thunk)))`
* Signals used throughout (including to drive current output summaries)
 * assertions passing and failing
 * tests starting and completeing
 * test batches starting and completeing
 * Dynamic variables available in signal handlers and all tests
   *unit-test* and *results*
* Logging used throughout (to ease debugging of lisp-unit2)
* TAP output first class and displays messages about the error
* Better job of reporting compiler warnings and errors: when defining
  the test (and while running it)


### Extensions

* Floating point predicates

### How to use lisp-unit

1. Load using [Quicklisp][] : `(ql:quickload :lisp-unit)` or [ASDF][]
   : `(asdf:load-system :lisp-unit)`.
2. Define some tests (for best luck define tests in their own package
   by making their name be in a specific package).  By having tests in
   their own package, the test and the fn being tested can share the
   same name. (Tests are compiled to a function named after the test
   that runs it and an object in the test database)
```
(lisp-unit:define-test my-tests::test-subtraction 
    (:tags '(my-tests::bar))
  (assert-eql 1 (- 2 1)))
```
3. Run all tests in your package
```
;; with summary provides results while the tests are running
(with-summary ()
   (run-tests :package :my-tests))

;; to print the results after the run is complete
(print-summary (run-tests :tags 'my-tests::bar))

;; The difference is in whether or not the output occurs while the
;; tests are running or after all the tests have run

;; to disable the debugger:
(let (*debug-hook*)
  (run-tests :tests 'my-tests::test-subtraction))
```

See the internal test suite for more and better examples (internal-test/*)
