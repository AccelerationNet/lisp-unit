lisp-unit

lisp-unit is a Common Lisp library that supports unit testing. It is
an extension of the library written by Chris Riesbeck. There is a long
history of testing packages in Lisp, usually called "regression"
testers. More recent packages in Lisp and other languages have been
inspired by JUnit for Java.
